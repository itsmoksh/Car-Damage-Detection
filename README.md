## Car Damage Detection
This is a **Car Damage Detection App** built using **Streamlit** and **ResNet50**.  
This can help users and companies to classify the damage into categories just by having the image of vehicle image. It can classify the vehicle damage into six categories.

## Model Details 

1. Model was trained on 2300 labelled car images dataset.
2. It can classify the damage into six categories:
   - Front Normal
   - Front Breakage
   - Front Crushed
   - Rear Normal 
   - Rear Breakage
   - Rear Crushed
3. The model uses transfer learning approach with pre-trained weights of ResNet50.
4. The accuracy on validation set was around 80%.
5. Trained on diverse amount of data having different contrast, rotation and colour jitter.
